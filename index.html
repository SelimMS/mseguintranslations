        <h2>Do you have a project that needs translating into French and you require quality work? I can help you.</h2>
        <p>My name is Marjorie Seguin and I provide English to French translation services.<br>
         I take great pride in my work and since I started my translation career in 2005 my aim has always been the same: producing the best translations I possibly can.<br>
         As a French native speaker with over 10 years experience in the translation industry <strong>I have the necessary experience and know-how to produce quality translations that will benefit your business.</strong></p>
        <p>So if you have a written document that needs translating into French and quality is required, I can help you.<br>
        My areas of expertise are <a>marketing, business and sports & fitness.</a><br>
        I also specialise in <a>audiovisual translation</a> and provide a <a>subtitling service</a>.</p>
        <h2>Why trust me?</h2>
        <p>I am a fully qualified translator with an MA in Bilingual Translation (English-French) obtained at the University of Westminster in 2005.</p>
        <p>Moreover, I abide by a strict code of conduct to ensure the highest standards possible, and as such I only translate into my mother tongue and only accept projects within my areas of expertise.</p>

        <h3>Why use a professional translator?</h3>
        <p><em>You’ll get best results by developing an ongoing relationship with a translator (...).<br>
        The longer you work with them and the better they understand your business philosophy, strategy and products, the more eﬀective their texts will be.</em></p>
